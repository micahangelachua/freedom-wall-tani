"# freedom-wall-tani" 

what was planned: 
to use nodejs, ejs, expressjs and mongodb 
to create a bad example of a freedom wall (where anyone can post anonymously and also edit and delete anyone's post)

what we ended up with:
freedom wall with no frontend what-so-ever. just nodejs, expressjs and mongodb.
